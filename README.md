# 《ODE-based Recurrent Model-free Reinforcement Learning for POMDPs》
[Recurrent Model-Free RL Can Be a Strong Baseline for Many POMDPs]: https://github.com/twni2016/pomdp-baselines
The code has not been fully refactored. But the baseline and codebase could be found in [Recurrent Model-Free RL Can Be a Strong Baseline for Many POMDPs].
Modifying the recurrent model with GRU-ODE proposed in our work could generally work.
